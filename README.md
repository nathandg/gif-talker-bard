# Gif Talker with Bard

### This project merges Bard and GifTalkr in a playful way.

The Gif Talker with Bard project offers a fun, interactive way to merge two technologies: Bard and GifTalkr. We used the repository https://github.com/PawanOsman/GoogleBard and integrated it with GifTalkr using ```npm install googlebard```.

## Usage

This project only works on Chrome, and you need to enable your microphone and is running on http://gif-bard.onrender.com.
Alternatively, you can run it on your computer, but you need a Google Bard token. To obtain the cookies, follow the steps in /PawanOsman/GoogleBard and insert it into the .env file.
